# Polymarket Changelog

> Welcome to the Polymarket Changelog. Here you will find any important changes to Polymarket, including but not limited to CLOB, API, UI and Mobile Applications.

<Update label="Apr 21, 2026" description="Relayer API: POST /submit returns immediately without transactionHash">
  * **Faster `POST /submit` responses**: The Relayer's `POST /submit` endpoint now returns immediately with just `{ transactionID, state: "STATE_NEW" }`. The `transactionHash` field has been removed from the submit response to improve performance.
  * **How to get the hash**: Poll [`GET /transaction`](/api-reference/relayer/get-a-transaction-by-id) with the returned `transactionID` to retrieve the onchain `transactionHash` once the transaction has been broadcast.
</Update>

<Update label="Apr 17, 2026" description="CLOB V2: upgrades go live April 28 at ~11:00 UTC, with ~1 hour of downtime">
  Polymarket is shipping a coordinated upgrade: **new Exchange contracts, a rewritten CLOB backend, and a new collateral token (pUSD)**.

  **Exchange upgrades go live April 28, 2026 at \~11:00 UTC with \~1 hour of downtime.** All integrations must migrate to the V2 SDK before the cutover — there will be no backward compatibility after go-live.

  **Full walkthrough:** [Migrating to CLOB V2](/v2-migration). Follow [Discord](https://discord.gg/polymarket), Telegram, and [status.polymarket.com](https://status.polymarket.com) for the exact start time.

  **Test against V2 now:** point your client at `https://clob-v2.polymarket.com`. On April 28, V2 takes over `https://clob.polymarket.com`, so no base-URL change is needed after the cutover.

  **What's changing**

  * New Exchange contracts (CTF Exchange V2 + Neg Risk CTF Exchange V2)
  * **pUSD** replaces USDC.e as the collateral token (standard ERC-20 on Polygon, backed by USDC, backing enforced onchain)
  * Order struct: `nonce`, `feeRateBps`, `taker` removed — `timestamp` (ms), `metadata`, `builder` added
  * Fees are now set at match time — no more `feeRateBps` on orders
  * Builder attribution is native via `builderCode` on orders (no more `builder-signing-sdk`)
  * EIP-712 Exchange domain version bumps from `"1"` to `"2"` (ClobAuth stays at `"1"`)

  **What you need to do**

  * Install the V2 SDK — [`@polymarket/clob-client-v2`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@polymarket/clob-client-v2) or [`py-clob-client-v2`](https://pypi.org/project/py-clob-client-v2/) — and remove the legacy `clob-client` / `py-clob-client` packages
  * Update constructor from positional args to options object; rename `chainId` → `chain`
  * Remove `feeRateBps`, `nonce`, and `taker` from your order creation code
  * If you're a builder, copy your code from [Settings → Builder](https://polymarket.com/settings?tab=builder) and attach it to orders
  * If you sign orders without the SDK, update the `verifyingContract` and the signed Order fields — see [For API users](/v2-migration#for-api-users)
  * Plan for all open orders to be wiped at cutover

  **During the window:** Trading will be paused for \~1 hour on April 28 starting around 11:00 UTC. The SDK's hot-swap mechanism will auto-refresh the client when V2 goes live — no manual action needed if you're on the latest SDK.
</Update>

<Update label="Apr 13, 2026" description="Bridge API: added support link for bridging issues">
  * **Support contact**: Added a link to [our Bridge API provider's support](https://intercom.help/funxyz/en/articles/10732578-contact-us) (Fun.xyz) for failed, stuck, or compliance-held bridge transactions. See [Deposit Status](/trading/bridge/status).
</Update>

<Update label="Apr 10, 2026" description="New keyset pagination endpoints for markets and events">
  * **New endpoints**: Added `GET /markets/keyset` and `GET /events/keyset` for cursor-based pagination, replacing offset-based `GET /markets` and `GET /events`.
  * **How it works**: These use an opaque `after_cursor`/`next_cursor` token instead of `offset`, providing stable and efficient paging through large result sets. Same filters, same response shape per item — the only differences are the wrapper response (`{ "markets": [...], "next_cursor": "..." }`) and the rejection of `offset`.
  * **Migration**: The existing `GET /markets` and `GET /events` endpoints remain available but will be deprecated in a future release. New integrations should use the keyset variants.
</Update>

<Update label="Apr 9, 2026" description="GET /markets: closed defaults to false">
  * **`closed` default change**: The `closed` query parameter on `GET /markets` now defaults to `false`. Closed markets are excluded from results unless you explicitly pass `closed=true`.
</Update>

<Update label="Mar 31, 2026" description="REST API Fee Fields Update">
  * **Fee calculation source**: Fees should now be calculated using the `feeSchedule` object within a market.
</Update>

<Update label="Mar 30, 2026" description="Fee Structure V2">
  * **New fee categories**: Fees now apply to Crypto, Sports, Finance, Politics, Economics, Culture, Weather, Tech, Mentions, and Other / General markets with updated rates per category. Geopolitical and world events markets remain fee-free.
  * **Updated documentation**: [Fees](/trading/fees) and [Maker Rebates Program](/market-makers/maker-rebates).
</Update>

<Update label="Mar 17, 2026" description="March Madness: $2M+ in Liquidity Rewards">
  * **March Madness Liquidity Rewards**: Adding \$2M+ in liquidity rewards to both live and pregame markets.
  * **How it works**: Liquidity rewards are payments for placing competitive bids. Rewards are paid out based on the size of your orders, how close they are to the midpoint, and how consistently they are quoted relative to other liquidity providers. Orders must be active on the book for a minimum of **3.5 seconds** to be eligible.

  **Daily reward rates for markets (subject to change):**

  **48 hours before GameStartTime:**

  * \$7.5k for full game ML market
  * \$500 for 5 other markets (most recently created full game spread, most recently created full game total, 1st half ML, most recently created 1st half spread, most recently created 1st half total)

  **From game live to game completion (note: rewards are expressed in daily rates):**

  * \$60k for full game ML
  * \$4k for most recently created full game spread and most recently created full game total

  **From game live to halftime (note: rewards are expressed in daily rates):**

  * \$8k for 1st half ML, most recently created 1st half spread, most recently created 1st half total

<Update label="May 28, 2025" description="New FAK Order Type">
  We’re excited to introduce a new order type soon to be available to all users: Fill and Kill (FAK). FAK orders behave similarly to the well-known Fill or Kill (FOK) orders, but with a key difference:

  * FAK will fill as many shares as possible immediately at your specified price, and any remaining unfilled portion will be canceled.
  * Unlike FOK, which requires the entire order to fill instantly or be canceled, FAK is more flexible and aims to capture partial fills if possible.
